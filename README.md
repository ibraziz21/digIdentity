# Requirements

Identity Creation: The smart contract should allow users to create a digital identity on the blockchain. This identity should be unique, and users should be able to prove ownership of the identity.

Identity Verification: The smart contract should enable the verification of a user's identity. This could be done by requiring the user to provide proof of identity through an external verification service.

Identity Management: The smart contract should allow users to manage their digital identity. This could include adding or removing information, updating information, or revoking access to the identity.

Access Control: The smart contract should enable access control for the digital identity. This could include defining who has access to the identity, and under what circumstances access is granted.
